## Hi, I’m Abubakar 👋

Smart Contract Engineer focused on designing, testing, and stress-testing EVM smart contracts.

I primarily work with **Solidity** and **Foundry**, building protocol-level systems with a strong emphasis on correctness, testing depth, and security assumptions. My interests include DeFi primitives, account abstraction, wallet infrastructure, and cross-chain messaging.

---

### 🧠 What I Work On

- **Smart contract wallets** (ERC-4337, modular architectures, minimal proxies)
- **DeFi protocols** (stablecoins, LP farming, liquidation & health-factor mechanics)
- **Protocol testing** (unit, fuzz, and invariant testing with Foundry)
- **Chainlink integrations** (VRF, Automation, CCIP)
- **Security-minded development** and failure-mode analysis

---

### 🚀 Selected Projects

- **TREZO Wallet**  
  ERC-4337 smart contract wallet with a modular architecture, upgradeable instances (EIP-1167), and on-chain social recovery.

- **Decentralized Stablecoin Protocol**  
  Overcollateralized stablecoin using Chainlink price feeds, with extensive unit, fuzz, and invariant testing to enforce solvency guarantees.

- **Cross-Chain Rebase Token (CCIP)**  
  Interest-accruing ERC20 minted via an ETH vault, with a custom Chainlink CCIP TokenPool preserving per-user interest rates across chains.

- **Chainlink VRF Raffle Platform**  
  Factory-based raffle system using Chainlink VRF v2.5 and Automation, validated with deterministic Foundry tests.

### 🧪 Engineering Philosophy

I treat smart contracts as **financial infrastructure**, not application code.

That means:
- Designing with explicit invariants and safety constraints
- Writing tests that attempt to break assumptions
- Preferring simple, auditable designs over clever abstractions

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** Solidity, EVM, ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-4337, OpenZeppelin  
- **Tooling:** Foundry (forge, cast), Chainlink, viem, wagmi  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, React Native  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Supabase
